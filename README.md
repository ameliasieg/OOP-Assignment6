# OOP-Assignment6

Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming I (a.k.a. Object-Oriented Programming)- Programming Assignment 6

In this programming assignment, I have created a polymorphic list of derived objects and demonstrated my ability to create and use purely virtual functions. I created an abstract base class called Animal with a single purely virtual function called MakeSound. Then, I created four derived classes that derive from that abstract base class: Dog, Cat, Pig, Cow that each implement the MakeSound function, which will print the respective sound to standard output. Finally, I created a driver that allows an end user to add whatever animals they want or print the list, which calls the MakeSound function on each item in the list in the order they were added to the list. The user also has an option to end the program.
